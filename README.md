ElasticSearchAuditModule is a module for Sitefinity CMS that is used in conjunction with Audit Trail module. When both modules are activated it allows an administator to monitor the actions performed by the various users and processes of the system through [Kibana](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/ "Kibana"). Actions are logged by Type, Name, TimeStamp, user performing the actions, user affected by the action and others. There are some predefined dashboards to help you start with user permissions, content changes and backend access. You could find them in the Dashboards folder.
You should install this module as any other Sitefinity module as explained in [this](http://www.sitefinity.com/blogs/team-blog/2011/07/20/creating_sitefinity_4_content_modules_part_5_module_installation "this") article.
